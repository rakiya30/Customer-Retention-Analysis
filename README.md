- Customer Segmentation: Through careful analysis we identified distinct customer segments
based on their behaviour, demographics and preferences understanding these segments can
help tailor retention strategies to specific customer needs. Our analysis also revealed that
the number of male customers was higher than females. also, not senior citizen in the
gender male made up 42.33%, Average count of customer was higher for male (1777.50)
Female (1744). Majority of our customers do not have partners nor dependents.

- Churn patterns: We observed that significant number of customers churn after one month
of their relationship with the company. Also, Month to month contract also accounts for the
highest number of churn when compared with the two other types of contracts. This
indicates the importance of focusing on early engagement and ensuring positive onboarding
experience.

- Contract: from our findings most customers opt for the month- month contract which
amounted to (3875), two year (1695) and one year (1473). However there seem to be a high
churn trend with customers who opted for the month- month contract.

- Payment method: most customers seem to prefer the Electronic check which takes up
33.58% of the total number of customers who use the service, Mail check (22.89%), Bank
transfer (21.92%), and the least preferred payment method Credit card (21.61%).

- Ticket: A total of 3632 Admin tickets and 2955 Tech Tickets were opened.

- Tenure: from the insights the least tenure is one month with 72 months been the highest.
  


### Recommendations:

1. Provide additional benefits and loyalty rewards for customers who opt for contracts more
than one year contact as the insights reveal that these types of customers maintain a long
relationship with the business and the least number of churned.

2. Prioritize resolving customer tickets promptly and provide additional training and support to
staff on how to deal with customer query.

3. Encourage more customers to use their credit cards to make payment by offering cash backs
and exclusive discounts and points. This can also encourage customer retention and
referrals.

4. Target senior citizens by making services and payment methods seamless and user-friendly
offering discounts especially on birthdays.

5. Customer feedback: implement a system for collecting and analysing customer feedback.
This can include surveys, feedback form, follow up emails. Actively listen to customers
concerns address their needs and use their feedback to drive continuous improvements.

I believe that implementing these recommendations will significantly improve customer retention
and reduce churn rate.
