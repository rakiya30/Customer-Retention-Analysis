Data Modeling
dataset comprised of just one table and no relationships were created




Dax Measures Creation
In addition to the data cleaning and data modelling,I created some Mesures to gain critical and deeper insights.

the following measures were created:

Total calls Resolved
Total calls Unresolved
Overall customer satisfaction
Count of satisfaction Rating
Exploratory Data Analysis
What is the Overall customer satisfaction?
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
What is the Average speed of answer by agent?
Agents performance quadrant (average handle time talk duration/calls answered)
What is the total number of calls resolved?
what is the average satisfaction rating?
Data Analysis and Insights

Recommendations
Enhance agent training: Identify key patterns and behaviors in customer-agent interactions over time. Use this analysis to improve agent training programs, focusing on areas that require attention or additional development. This will empower agents to better handle customer inquiries and provide more effective solutions.

Implement self-service options: Identify common customer issues that can be resolved through self-service options. Develop and implement self-service tools such as knowledge bases, FAQs, or automated chatbots. This will enable customers to find answers to their queries independently, reducing the overall workload on agents and improving efficiency.

Personalize customer interactions: Leverage the insights gained from the analysis to personalize customer interactions. Utilize customer data to understand preferences, history, and previous interactions. This will enable agents to tailor their approach and provide a more personalized experience, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Continuously monitor and optimize processes: Establish a system for ongoing monitoring of customer-agent interactions and performance metrics. Regularly
