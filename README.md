### Overview:
- The Churn Rate for Databel is 27% and 45% of the reasons why customers churn is related to competitors.
- A total of 1796 Databel Customers Churned
- The Churn Rate in Califonia is Abnormally high at 60%. Our insights also reveal that Customers within CA had the highest churn rate for customers who have a month-month contract
- Customers who have monthly contracts churn more than customers who have yearly based contracts.
  
  
### Customer Segmentation:
-  Through careful analysis we identified distinct customer segments
based on their behaviour, demographics and preferences understanding these segments can
help tailor retention strategies to specific customer needs. Our analysis also revealed that at 38.46%, Senior had the highest Churn Rate and was 67.20% higher than Under 30, which had the lowest Churn Rate at 23.00%.

### Churn patterns:
- direct debit had the highest Average of Account Length (in months) (50.53) and Paper Check had the highest Churn Rate (57.33%). The Contract Category with the highest Average of Account Length (in months) was Yearly and the Contract Category with the highest Churn Rate was Monthly.﻿Also, Month to month contract also accounts for the
highest number of churn when compared with the two other types of contracts. This
indicates the importance of focusing on early engagement and ensuring positive onboarding
experience.

### Payment Method:
-Direct Debit had the highest Number of Customers at 3702, followed by Credit Card at 2614 and Paper Check at 371.﻿ from our findings ﻿
﻿﻿Direct Debit accounted for 71.62% of Number of Customers.﻿﻿
﻿﻿

### Insights:
-  Less than 5GB in Unlimited Data Plan  made up 20.70% of Churn Rate.
- Average Churn Rate was higher for Yes (0.32) than No (0.24).
- Churn Rate for Yes and No diverged the most when the Grouped Consumption was Less than 5GB, when Yes were 22.40% higher than No.
- We also observed that 72% of customers who actively make international calls but do not have an international plan.
- Also customers who belong to age group 50 and have account length of 12 months we noticed that the churn rate for this group increases over time.
- The Average number of customer servicecalls for customers who are on a monthly contract and pay by direct debit is at 1.47.
- 32% of customers pay extra for their additional usage because they are not on unlimited data plan

  


  


### Recommendations:

1. Provide additional benefits and loyalty rewards for customers who opt for contracts more
than one year contact as the insights reveal that these types of customers maintain a long
relationship with the business and the least number of churned.

2. Prioritize resolving customer tickets promptly and provide additional training and support to
staff on how to deal with customer query.

3. Encourage more customers to use their credit cards to make payment by offering cash backs
and exclusive discounts and points. This can also encourage customer retention and
referrals.

4. Target senior citizens by making services and payment methods seamless and user-friendly
offering discounts especially on birthdays.

5. Customer feedback: implement a system for collecting and analysing customer feedback.
This can include surveys, feedback form, follow up emails. Actively listen to customers
concerns address their needs and use their feedback to drive continuous improvements.

I believe that implementing these recommendations will significantly improve customer retention
and reduce churn rate.
